    <p>We lost the legendary <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Singmaster">David Singmaster</a> in <a
        href="https://mastodon.social/@robeastaway@mathstodon.xyz/109868800772262563">February 2023</a>. As a
      self-described "metagrobologist", he studied and catalogued many puzzles in his life. Singmaster was
      instrumental in early cubing, publishing:</p>

      <div>
        <a href="https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic.htm">The Cubic Circular</a> (1981-1985), where he <a
          href="https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic1.htm#p12">reported on early speedcubing competitions</a> and <a
          href="https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p4">the first World Championship</a>, extensive <a
          href="https://www.jaapsch.net/puzzles/cubic3.htm#p34">cube math</a>, <a

    <p>Singmaster was active and jovial into his 80's, traveling,
      making friends, and writing about puzzles. He was a "judge" on the jury panel in the 1982 World Champiohship, and
      also <a href="https://www.worldcubeassociation.org/persons/2012SING03">competed officially in 2012</a>. It's
      easy to take our modern speedcubing community for granted, but he effectively maintained one the
      first international cubing communities and it's likely that we wouldn't be quite the same without him.</p>

          I don't remember exactly
          how that happened - I think I first met him at a puzzle meet in London. What I do remember is his joy at
          showing me his puzzles, and his large collection of books on recreational mathematics. I regret that I only
          took one picture of the visit on my (analog) camera, namely a picture of his puzzle collection. I will always
          be indebted to him for inviting me to the Gathering for Gardner in 2004, which I have attended ever
          since.<span class="large">&rdquo;</span>

          Charlie Bucket on his first visit
          to
          Willy Wonka's chocolate factory, and then just replace sweets with puzzles. Thousands of them. Every shelf, in

          Not only was David an incredible collector of puzzles and puzzle history, he was only too happy to share his
          knowledge. He knew almost everything there was to know about puzzles – and when he didn’t, he always knew
          which book to look in.<span class="large">&rdquo;</span>
